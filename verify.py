""" Verifies data uploaded by this connector is similar to the data already on production.

It's not super effective but should provide confidence.
Expecting exact equality is kind of hard since datasets on Hugging Face may have been updated
whereas the indexed data on AI-on-Demand is not. This means that a recently synchronized local
database likely has different, more up-to-date, metadata.

The difference for the specific default repositories here confirm this. Awesome-gpt-prompts has
had its keywords and distributions updated.
